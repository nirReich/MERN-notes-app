# MERN-notes-app
Simple notes app using MERN stack
This is a simple notes app built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, and TypeScript.

# Getting Started
To get started with the app, first clone the repo and install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies for the server and the client.

Next, you will need to set up a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=<your-mongo-uri>
```
Replace <your-mongo-uri> with your MongoDB Atlas URI.

To start the server, run:
```
npm run server
```
To start the client, run:
```
npm run client
```
To start both the server and client concurrently, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the server on port 3001 and the client on port 3000.

# Usage
Once the app is running, you can use it to create, read, update, and delete notes.
